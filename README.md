# phys

Screwing around with some physics and processing.js. Right now, I can make arbitrary polygons, calculate some stuff about them, expose them to gravity, move 'em around (translation, rotation).

Next, torque. Then, constraints.

Using jquery just to hook up some key events, not *really* required.
